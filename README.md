# Hodgekin_HuxleyModel-electrophysiology-
This repository is set with the purpose for the hodgekin_huxleymodel for investigate how neurons respond to stimuli under different conditions and how action potentials are generated and change.
Neurons communicate through action potentials, which are brief but significant changes in the membrane potential. These changes are primarily due to the opening and closing of ion channels in the neuron's cell membrane. The Hodgkin-Huxley model was formulated to explain the ionic mechanisms underlying the initiation and propagation of action potentials.
